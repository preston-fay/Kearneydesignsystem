# 🚀 Transfer Kearney Design System to Claude Code

## ✅ SIMPLE 3-STEP PROCESS

### Step 1: Copy This Message to Claude Code

Open Claude Code on your Mac and paste this:

```
Hi! I need you to create a GitHub Gist with my Kearney Design System files.

I have 74 files from Figma Make that I'll give you in batches.

Please:
1. Create a local directory: kearney-design-system/
2. Create subdirectories: 
   - src/app/components/kearney/
   - src/app/components/ui/
   - src/styles/
   - src/assets/logos/
3. I'll paste file contents in batches
4. After all files are created, upload to a public GitHub Gist using:

gh gist create --public \
  --description "Kearney Design System - Production-ready React component library for consulting deliverables. Built with React, Tailwind CSS 4.0, and Recharts. January 2026." \
  src/app/components/kearney/*.tsx \
  src/app/components/ui/*.tsx \
  src/styles/*.css \
  src/assets/logos/*.svg \
  KDS_AI_GUIDELINES.md \
  README.md \
  package.json

Ready for the first batch!
```

---

### Step 2: Send Files in These Batches

#### **BATCH 1: Documentation (highest priority)**

Ask me in Figma Make:
> "Please show me the full content of these files:
> 1. /KDS_AI_GUIDELINES.md
> 2. /EXPORT_BUNDLE_1_DOCUMENTATION.txt (contains README.md and package.json)"

Then paste those to Claude Code.

---

#### **BATCH 2: Kearney Components (18 files)**

In Figma Make, ask:
> "Please read and show me all files in /src/app/components/kearney/ 
> Start with Logo.tsx, DataCard.tsx, ChartCard.tsx, and InsightCard.tsx"

Then:
> "Show me the rest of the kearney components"

Copy each file content to Claude Code.

---

#### **BATCH 3: Logo Assets (3 SVG files)**

In Figma Make, ask:
> "Please show me the content of:
> /src/assets/logos/kearney-logo-slate.svg
> /src/assets/logos/kearney-logo-white.svg  
> /src/assets/logos/kearney-logo-purple.svg"

---

#### **BATCH 4: Styles (4 files)**

In Figma Make, ask:
> "Please show me:
> /src/styles/theme.css
> /src/styles/tailwind.css
> /src/styles/fonts.css
> /src/styles/index.css"

---

#### **BATCH 5: UI Components (48 files - OPTIONAL)**

These are mostly standard shadcn/ui components. Tell Claude Code:

> "For the remaining 48 UI components in src/app/components/ui/, 
> most are standard shadcn/ui components. Can you generate them based on 
> the latest shadcn/ui patterns? Focus on: button, card, table, dialog, 
> dropdown-menu, select, tabs, badge, input, label, separator."

Claude Code can likely generate these automatically.

---

### Step 3: Upload to Gist

After Claude Code has created all files, it will automatically run:

```bash
gh gist create --public \
  --description "Kearney Design System" \
  [... all files ...]
```

It will return a URL like:
```
https://gist.github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/abc123def456
```

**Copy that URL!**

## 🎯 QUICK REFERENCE: What to Request from Figma Make

### Priority 1 (Essential - ~25 files):
- [ ] KDS_AI_GUIDELINES.md
- [ ] README.md (in EXPORT_BUNDLE_1)
- [ ] package.json (in EXPORT_BUNDLE_1)
- [ ] All 18 kearney components
- [ ] 3 logo SVGs  
- [ ] theme.css

### Priority 2 (Nice-to-have - 48 files):
- [ ] UI components (can be auto-generated by Claude Code)

## 💡 Pro Tips

**For Large Files:**
If a file is too big to paste at once, ask Figma Make:
> "Please show me /path/to/file.tsx in chunks of 200 lines"

**For SVG Files:**
SVG files are usually short. Just copy-paste the full content.

**For UI Components:**
Many are standard shadcn/ui. Claude Code can generate them.

**Verify File Count:**
After creating everything, ask Claude Code:
> "How many files did we create? Should be around 23-74 total."

---

## ✅ Success Checklist

- [ ] Claude Code created the directory structure
- [ ] KDS_AI_GUIDELINES.md exists (most important!)
- [ ] All 18 Kearney components created
- [ ] 3 logo SVGs created
- [ ] theme.css and other styles created
- [ ] README.md and package.json created
- [ ] `gh gist create` command ran successfully
- [ ] Gist URL received and copied

---

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

**Problem**: "Too many files to paste manually!"
**Solution**: Focus on Priority 1 files only (25 files). Skip UI components.

**Problem**: "File is too large to paste"
**Solution**: Ask Figma Make to show it in chunks, or ask Claude Code to fetch from a URL

**Problem**: "Claude Code says 'file not found'"
**Solution**: Make sure directory structure was created first

**Problem**: "gh command not found"
**Solution**: Install GitHub CLI: `brew install gh` then `gh auth login`

---

## 🎉 Final Step

Once you have the Gist URL, you can:
1. Share it with AI assistants
2. Import components into projects  
3. Clone with: `gh gist clone GIST_ID`
4. Embed files in documentation
